Node inspector instead of/in addition to params in graph view

Node Types:
   color nodes:
        palette  -- improve
        spline
   beats!
        other segmenters
        IP: breakdown viewer & editor
        multiply & divide beats (double/half)
        offsets
        bar float output
   region sequence
   Conversion nodes between float & int
   math nodes
   Paths
   Use openGL for shading
   Comp nodes
   perlin noise
   particle systems

song queue

better color systems than HSV (see https://github.com/jrus/chromatist and
    http://www.husl-colors.org)

Mixer style fading

Fader

Compositing modes
Firing decay modes

playback controller
    multiple queued songs
    Load dlite file from dir with wave

Export/bake

IP:  more Shape rendering with QPainter

global hotkeys:
  frame all / frame selected  (Still a little funky)

compmode & decaymode pups on cuewidgets

put spectrograph options back in somewhere.

Drawing:
    LOD
        Turn off level meters when small
        longer tangents when small
    drop shadow
    nicer active-mode control widget
    Grid BG option in graph view
    nicer colors
    color-coded paramitems
    color-coded connectors
    param-view transparent bg
    arrows on connectors
    be able to scroll even when current scene is entirely visible.



"_dirty" bit

Cleaning:
    Remnants of original spectrum audio recording stuff in bufferlength and
    windowchanged things
    Clean up object model & separation-of-concerns,
        esp wrt CuesheetView/Scene/GraphWidget
    Get rid of Lightcolor and use QColor

Bugs:
    XXX moving playhead back in time breaks beat nodes. (as well as new song)
    editor widgets should give up focus when enter is hit
    AudioNotify drop
    Potential UUID collisions; should only store UUIDs during
        serialization and deserialization

FFTs
    Center fft window about playback position, rather than looking backwards
    provide offsets for fft window
    allow changing fft window size
    Pre-xform entire file?
    use fftw???
